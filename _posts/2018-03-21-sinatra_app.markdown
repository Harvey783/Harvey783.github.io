This project was considerably easier than the CLI Date Gem project. I was able to use a lot of the code form previous labs in the app which helped considerably. Honestly, most of my time was spent incorporating Bootstrap so the app wouldn't look so visually unappealing. I'm actually thankful for that because my experience with Bootstrap was quite limited so I was glad to gain some experience and familiarity with it.
